This repo contains supplemental notebooks of auxillary EDA, data cleaning, and model exploration illustrated in the final report for cs109b Advanced Data Sciences course final project. The notebooks in this repository are not designed to be run in sequential numbered order to reproduce the results shown in the final report. They just show the extra works and experiments we have tried that are not shown in the final report.
