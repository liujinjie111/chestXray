The code and results reported in this notebook are only a summary of the work completed for this project - they represent the final form of our analyses. Supplemental notebooks containing auxillary EDA, data cleaning, and model exploration illustrated in this report can be found in the notebooks/ directory of the GitHub project repository. The notebooks in that repository are designed to be run in sequential numbered order to reproduce the results shown here. In addition, throughout this report, we will provide links to specific supporting notebooks for further reference.
